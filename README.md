# react-display-console

Display the `console` inside React app

![preview](./doc/preview.png)

## Install

```
npm i react-display-console --production
```

## Usage

```jsx
import Console from 'react-display-console'

<Console input theme='dark' />

...

console.log('store/get', { list: [{ id: 123, name: 'Phone' }, { id: 123, name: 'Keyboard' }] })
console.info('Loading from http://my.api/', { method: 'GET', query: 'order=name&page=9' })
console.error(new Error('invalid JSON object'))

```

### props

- **input**
  show input at bottom to write statements, like in real `console`

- **theme** (optional)
  use a theme class; available builtin themes are:

  - `default`  
![theme-default](./doc/theme-default.png)

  - `dark`  
![theme-dark](./doc/theme-dark.png)


## How it works

When the component is invoked, it wrap `console` methods and it use them in a `React.context`, so any call relay to `<Console>` component and regular `console`.

## How to add and use a custom theme

Define a css style for `.console`, for example `.console.my` (see `src/style/themes.scss` for example and class definition). Use the prop `theme='my'` in `<Console>`

- `my.css`

```css
.console.my {
  background-color: grey;
  color: darkblue;

  ...
}
```

then

```jsx
<Console theme='my' />
```

## Purpose

`react-display-console` component arises from the need to view the console output in the browser for educational, development or debugging purposes, especially when it's difficult to access devtools in non-desktop environments (mobile, TV etc).
